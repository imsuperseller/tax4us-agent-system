# üîê GitHub Repository Secrets Setup

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Set Up Repository Secrets**

The GitHub Actions workflow requires these secrets to be configured in your GitHub repository:

### **Required Secrets**

1. **VERCEL_TOKEN**
   - Value: `YUAzEHrCMQSwq7dlqknuUMoi`
   - Purpose: Authentication for Vercel deployment

2. **VERCEL_TEAM_ID**
   - Value: `team_SEnaotre0c8j0LYup48DbA3f`
   - Purpose: Vercel team/organization ID

3. **VERCEL_PROJECT_ID**
   - Value: `prj_n2NRVyGSFmaZFhWSbcXRCiAx4hiu`
   - Purpose: Vercel project ID

### **How to Add Secrets**

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/imsuperseller/tax4us-agent-system
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret**
5. Add each secret with the exact name and value above

### **Why You See Linting Warnings**

The warnings in your editor are normal and expected because:
- The secrets haven't been added to the repository yet
- The GitHub Actions extension can't validate secrets that don't exist
- These warnings will disappear once secrets are configured

### **Workflow Status**

- ‚úÖ Workflow syntax is correct
- ‚úÖ Actions will work once secrets are added
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Secrets need to be configured in GitHub

### **After Adding Secrets**

Once you add the secrets:
1. Push any change to trigger the workflow
2. Check the **Actions** tab in GitHub
3. The deployment should work automatically

**Note:** The workflow is correctly configured. The warnings are just the editor being cautious about missing secrets.
